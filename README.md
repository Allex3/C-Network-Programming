NOTE FOR THE "GROUPCHAT" SERVER AND CLIENT: I only handled what happens when apps are closed by the "X" or i guess alt F4 on windows so that the server and other clients still works
also /close on a client closes it, the server never closes, if the server closes and you try to input something the client finishes running
